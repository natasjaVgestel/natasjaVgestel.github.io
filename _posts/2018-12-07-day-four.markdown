# Let the Journey begin - 
Today we depart for Antarctica. The journey will take four days, including two days on the infamous [Drake Passage][Drake]. This area is known to have the roughest seas in the world. Hopefully our ship, the RV [Laurence Gould][Gould], named after famous explorer and scientist [Laurence McKinley Gould][LMG] will take us through safely.

One of the many things to look forward to during the crossing (and to distract oneself from thinking too much about sea sickness) is the sheer abundance of wildlife. Fingers crossed for smooth "sailing" and lots of wildlife. Here we are departing Punta Arenas. We will see this town again in April.
