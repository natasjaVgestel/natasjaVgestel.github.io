# Glacier:   
The retreat of the glacier in the last 60 years or so has made my current research possible, because I am using the newly exposed soil in my experiment. What the glacier also makes possible is to have solitude. 

Last night I hiked up the glacier - noting the differences in ice structure at the base of the glacier: from beautifully peaked ice crystals (left photo below) and transitioning into terrace-like ice higher up (right photo).

There was no one else on the glacier, so I took selfies of my shadow. The sun was setting, making my shadow particularly long (and funny!).

At Palmer Station, one is always surrounded by people. I am somewhat of an introvert, needing a bit of space and quiet now and then. The glacier was my refuge. On top of the glacier I was rewarded by a fantastic sunset that lit up the mountains behind it. It was breathtaking. 

I sipped my hot chocolate and just sat, and sat.. and watched. 

Enjoy the view with me:
