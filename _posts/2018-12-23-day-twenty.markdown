# Inclement weather
Alas, when the snow moved horizontal past my window I knew we would not be able to go outside. We still need to find two other two sites in the Palmer Backyard (as the deglaciated area behind Palmer Station is nicknamed). Being confined to indoors today, we made ourselves useful. Kelly was able to find strategic ways by which we could safely transport the LI-COR instruments. Thanks to frame backpacks kindly provided by Marissa and Kelly's creativity, we are now able to more comfortably hike with the LI-CORs.

Meanwhile I set to making my first drawing. I thoroughly enjoy drawing, but have not had much time during the school year to do so. It was wonderful to just draw at the desk in the room that Kelly and I share. The desk overlooks the glacier (or at least on clearer days). Today I drew a giant petrel, with photo provided by Darren and Megan Roberts. This magnificent bird is one that they study. One of the things they are able to assess is how far these birds travels for food!

One of my heroes is [Edward Wilson](https://www.edwardawilson.com/) who was on the ill-fated expedition with Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole. Wilson was a doctor during the expedition and a great artist. I always admired him for his many talents, including the beautiful watercolor drawings he has made throughout his journeys in Antarctica. I cannot follow in his footsteps, but his drawings have inspired me to draw when I can in Antarctica.
