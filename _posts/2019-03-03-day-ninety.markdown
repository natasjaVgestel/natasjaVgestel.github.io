# Antarctica: food for the soul   
A few days ago my aunt Annemieke passed away in her sleep. It was a shock to me. Although I had not known her very well, I had always admired Annemieke: her fierce independence and strong mind. She had a house with solar panels - she was a forward thinker and loved to garden! She reminded me a bit of me in that respect. 

When I hiked up the glacier on [day 88](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/03/01/day-eighty-eight), it was in part because I needed some space and quiet to deal with a loss in the family. Finding that solitude was liberating, especially for an introvert like me. 

Headed back down to Palmer Station after spending about an hour up the glacier had an energizing, yet soothing effect on me.

This morning I was greeted by a spectacular sky just before sunrise. I find this beautiful environment to be nurturing for the soul. I count myself lucky to be among those able to work in Antarctica. I cherish this amazing opportunity every day. My aunt had Alzheimer's so she may not have known I was here - but in those brief, clear moments, I am sure she was proud.
