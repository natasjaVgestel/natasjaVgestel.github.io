# The Drake Passage - day one: 
We are lucky - if we had left earlier as had originally been planned, the crossing would have been worse. Nevertheless, the ship is heaving, pitching and rolling sideways as it is going onward. Last night we had 20 to 24 foot swells, and because because many of the beds are perpendicular to the direction of the ship, I found my stomach at times to be far above my head. Needless to say, I woke up plenty times last night, and not feeling all that good.

With all this motion, we still have to work and eat. Here is the dining area, located on the main deck.

Of interest is to note that the main deck that the dining area is at, is not below sea level. The port holes on the starboard (= right side of the ship) of the dining hall area resemble the window of a washing machine. You can see that we occasionally dip below sea surface as the ship sways sideways.
