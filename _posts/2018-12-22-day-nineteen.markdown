# Protocols written
It was a foggy/rainy/snowy day. A great day for indoor activity. I wrote up the protocols to use in the field regarding how to measure carbon fluxes. The protocols will help in standardizing our measurements. Standardization is good - in field ecology we already deal with lots of variability. A protocol will help minimize variability caused by the user. Reproducibility is key to science.

# Marr Ice Piedmont
The Marr Ice Piedmont is the glacier behind Palmer Station that has receded several hundred meters in the last five decades. It is the area that has been deglaciated by this glacier that is our study area. It is a beautiful domed glacier that provides spectacular views of the surrounding area. It is baffling to know how much climate change has already affected this glacier.

The first image features Kelly as she is taking in the stunning scenery (and perhaps contemplating the study area and the big questions in research).

The image below was taken by Kelly. It shows me simply contemplating what the best composition is for my next photo.
