# Christmas Eve: 
Today an art & craft group gathered to make gifts for the White Elephant gift exchange tomorrow. This means I was able to make a second drawing that I will add to the Christmas tree. This time I drew an Adélie Penguin, a charismatic species that is ice-dependent. This species of penguin has been declining in numbers around the Palmer area. For an excellent read on the many reasons why, please see ["Fraser's Penguins"](https://www.fenmontaigne.com/frasers-penguins) written by Fen Montaigne. In fact, it was this book that inspired my husband and I to visit Antarctica in 2011. Bill Fraser has been studying the penguin populations in the Palmer area (and other areas also) for a very long time, noting the demise of the beautiful Adélie penguins. He will be at Palmer Station shortly!
