Meet Levi Littrel and Andy White - two professionals that build and maintain towers and antennae on station. They were trained to operate on tall structures, to look for weaknesses and ensure that the towers are in good condition. These towers can be used for telecommunication or for weather stations. In the photo below they are working on the repeater on top of the glacier behind Palmer Station (left and right are Levi and Andy, respectively).

Communication in the Palmer area is still relatively restricted. Once you turn the corner on southwest Anvers Island, there is no more radio communication - at least, not yet! Levi and Andy, with PJ's help will be installing a new repeater to expand our range of communication (and thus be able to communicate around the corner).

In the photo below they are working on putting in a new weather tower.

They have been to the South Pole and McMurdo also to work on the towers and antennae there. One large benefit (at least in my opinion) is that they get to travel to places no one else goes: for example, to the top of the mountains near McMurdo, where they are dropped off by helicopter. Fascinating to be in a place only few will ever venture, but a necessity for safe science and support operations. 

Thank you, Levi and Andy for enabling the communication and data collection in Antarctica.
