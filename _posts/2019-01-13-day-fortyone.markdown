# Rec boating
Recreational boating is a great way to explore the Palmer area. Rec boating occurs when people have some time off from work or research. So rec boating usually occurs in the evenings or on Sundays. And what a paradise to do so! Last night we visited Cormorant Island. On the way there the sea looked like quicksilver - simply stunning!

We also visited Amsler Island (this was back in December). Amsler Island used to house the original Palmer Station (back in 1965), but a new Palmer station was built in 1968 (the one we are at now). Amsler Island is beautiful - the turquoise and dark blue waters, and impressive views of the mountains of the Antarctic Peninsula.

It really is fun to have a small group of people that enjoy these kinds of trips as much as I do! To be surrounded by spectacular nature - I simply cannot express the feeling. Thanks, Keri, for taking the photo of Kelly and I!

There are many islands accessible from Palmer Station, but often we just cruise around to see icebergs, porpoising penguins, or whales (though we keep a distance of course from all the above). See map below, published by the Environmental Research and Assessment for the US Antarctic Program (but others contributed info too - see right hand side). Palmer Station is in the bright red square. You can see there are plenty of nearby islands, and even a shipwreck! More about the shipwreck later!
