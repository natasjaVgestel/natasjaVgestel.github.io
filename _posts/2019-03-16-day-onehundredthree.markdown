# Gould departed on Pi day:
Two days ago when we watched Christina Koch's launch into space, we watched it those who had recently arrived on the Gould (who had just finished a research cruise searching for whales). So, it was particularly crowded in the lounge! However, it was also the day we said goodbye to several members of the Palmer family, who left when the Gould left that same day.

We were with 40 people on station before the Gould left on March 14, and now we are 31. That is a reduction of nearly 25%! The departure of nine people is noticeable.... I already miss them! The next time the ship returns, most of us will leave on it. A new group of people (but a smaller group), the winterovers (see [day 75](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/02/16/day-seventyfive)), will arrive on the next boat. 

Thus, this was the last time I get to see this perspective of the Laurence Gould. The next time, my view will be from the ship, looking back at Palmer Station.

My field season is coming to an end.....
