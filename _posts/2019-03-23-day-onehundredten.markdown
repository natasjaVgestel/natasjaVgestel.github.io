# Moonlit landscape:
The beauty of this place is simply astounding. Last night the moon rose over the glacier, bathing Arthur Harbour and the snow-covered landscape in a silvery glow.

Interestingly, the moon seems upside down from what we observe in the northern hemisphere! Not only that, when the moon goes from new to full moon during the month, the phase shift is opposite also! So, whereas in the northern hemisphere the moon becomes progressively brighter starting from the right, and moving to left until it is full moon, the southern hemisphere starts with the left side being the bright side first.

There is not much light at Palmer Station, so the nightsky on a cloudless night is bright! The moonlight is sufficient to find your path in the dark. Here, there are no trees to shade the ground and the white snow reflects much of moonlight. 

What an amazing place....

P.S. I took the left photo through my binoculars! You can even see craters!
