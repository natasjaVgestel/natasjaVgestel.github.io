# Another great Skype session!   
It was an exciting day today! Through Skype I met many kids from Northridge Elementary in Lubbock, TX. Thanks to their teachers Joanne Grothusen and Whitney Sarinana, the kids had been reading my blog and following me along on my adventure.

I was very impressed with the insightful questions! It was obvious they had done some research regarding Antarctica! Some questions dealt with moss and climate change, other questions were about soils and ice. They are now experts on soil and moss in Antarctica!

Mr. Morrison, the principal, had asked a question about the buildings and facilities. I did not even know where to begin! How to convey the sense of community of about 40 people on station, the research support or the comfort of Palmer Station, and all the amenities therein!

After the Skype session, I had a renewed sense of hope for our future. These kids were amazing, just like the kids from the Sinagua Middle School with whom we Skyped earlier (see [day 53](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/01/25/day-fiftythree)). A brighter future is ahead, I am certain of it.
