# Nature - Nothing is wasted:
Antarctica is beautiful, but it is not an easy life for plants and animals. Penguins and seals have to watch for predators, like the [leopard seal](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/03/15/day-onehundredtwo).

Thus, it looks peaceful and serene (if the wind is not blowing), especially from inside warm, cozy, Palmer Station, but organisms have to eke out a living here. When hiking on the islands I encountered skeletal remains of seabirds and seals. What I find fascinating is how little is left on the bones of the animals. Nothing is wasted (except for feathers and fur). Even though sad to know the animal has died, others have lived because of it. 

There is a quote in Avatar: "All energy is borrowed and one day we have to give it back". This is so true here also: there is energy in animal tissue that is tied up - the molecules are in reduced form in the tissue (meaning it has gained electrons). These electrons are then passed on to whoever eats the animal tissue. Because energy is tied to electrons, there is transfer of electrons (and hence energy) from one organism to the next.

Pretty cool.
