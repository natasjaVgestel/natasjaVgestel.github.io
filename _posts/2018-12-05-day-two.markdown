# Our equipment has arrived safely on the vessel
Many months ago, back in August, Kelly and I sent many boxes filled with scientific equipment to California. They have made their way to Punta Arenas, Chile. Today they were finally loaded on board.

Now that they were loaded, we could afford to relax a little! We found out our departure was delayed by at least a day. So, we ventured into town to enjoy the historic plaza, among other historical sites.

The plaza is surrounded by vibrant legume trees with striking yellow flowers. A tradition at the monument at the center of the plaza is to touch the toe of the sitting statue (at the bottom). This will bring good luck to those crossing the notorious waters of the Drake Passage. Needless to say, we honored this tradition.
