# Palmer Station - part II - 
In [part I](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/01/19/day-fortyseven) yesterday I discussed amenities from the BIO building. Today I will give you a virtual tour of the other main building - the GWR building. GWR stands for Gym, Warehouse and Recreation. Below are images of the gym and the adjacent laundry area. As you can see we can work up a sweat and conveniently wash our clothes nearby.

An important room in GWR is the lounge (left photo below). Here, people receive training upon arrival (e.g. safety training, waste management training, island survival training etc.). The lounge is also used for science talks, movie nights, and travel logs (where you share with others the various places you have traveled to).

Next to the lounge is the bar. The more delicate woodwork with the viking pattern was handmade on station. The bar also includes a pool table (that also serves as a ping-pong table). We also feature *Art in the Bar* on Sunday (thanks Zee, for organizing that).

The balcony on GWR is accessible from both the bar and the gym. Below is the view from inside the gym - one can see the balcony, the other main building (BIO), and the Palmer area beyond. I would like to say we are roughing it down here, but that would not be true. With all the amenities, living on station is - as you can see - quite a treat!
