# Sample transport to Gould:  
Today was a busy day packing our samples. The Gould will carry our samples back to Punta Arenas. Alicia had many samples frozen at -80 <sup>o</sup>C, so far colder than a regular freezer at home (which is -20 <sup>o</sup>C). Teamwork makes things go faster - Kelly was packing, while Alicia was collecting them from the -80 freezer, whereas I did nothing but take photos!

Alicia's samples include most of the incubation cores from the field, and a few collections of samples for sequencing. Other labs were packing up also, including Dr. Zicheng Yu's lab. They are sending back peat cores so they can make inferences about historical climate (at least of the last few thousand years, depending on the depth of their peat cores - see [day 52](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/01/24/day-fiftytwo))

All the samples were carried to the labs on the ship. It was a smooth operation thanks to the Marine Lab Technician from the Gould and Amy Brummit, the Palmer logistics person.
