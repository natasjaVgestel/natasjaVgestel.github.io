# The receding glacier - 
The glacier behind Palmer Station has been receding about 10 meters per year on average (see [day 51](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/day-fiftyone)). The glacier covers most of Anvers Island. From Palmer Station we have nice view of the glacier across Arthur Harbor. I took this photo last night at twilight.

It is about a 500 meter walk to reach the glacier edge from Palmer Station. It is striking to see how the glacier terminus looks different on land than on water. It is far more sloped on land and nearly vertical above the water.

Meltwater is present as little cascades and pools by the glacier edge. I explored the glacier terminus further and found a tiny opening. Peaking inside was glacial blue light, with drops falling from icicles.

So, before my eyes, the glacier is melting. My site (see arrow pointing to the tall flags) was covered by the glacier within the last two years (see [day 51](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/01/23/day-fiftyone)). I have to admit that the rate of retreat of this massive glacier concerns me greatly. As a scientist though, I am very interested to see how much life there is in the soil at my recently deglaciated site.
