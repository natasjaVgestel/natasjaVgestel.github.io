# Turnover:
Turnover has started. The Gould has arrived with the winterovers (see also [day 75](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/02/16/day-seventyfive)), while we will soon depart Palmer Station. On Tuesday the exchange will happen: most of us who have been on station this summer will move to the ship while those who arrived today will move to the station.

This is a particularly hectic time for everyone, including the grantees. Just today we finished packing our final box for cargo - for a total of eight boxes (not including our sample boxes). I am now realizing how little time I have left on station....
