# Laboratory:
Today I would like to acknowledge the science support given by Carolyn and Randy. Carolyn is the instrument technician and Randy is the lab supervisor at Palmer Station. However, they do so much more!

When I first arrived, it felt very welcoming: Carolyn had customized my lab space in such a way that would best fit my science. She installed plenty of drawers, had items that I had requested ready for me in my lab, and ensured that the instruments were in working order. 

Randy oversees much of the grantee science and coordinates the volunteer groups. Do I (or another grantee) need help in the field? Talk to Randy. Do I need a 0<sup>o</sup>C incubator? Talk to Randy. He also collects all the science reports and distributes them to the station and NSF and he organizes the weekly science talks. We had already spoken by phone a day or so before I arrived at Palmer Station to give me an update on the field conditions (there was still a lot of snow when I arrived) and to discuss with me the timing of the offloading of my equipment and supplies.

Carolyn and Randy have been instrumental (pardon the pun) in helping me with my research. I also simply love to swing by Carolyn's office and see her excitement when Kelly or I show her some cool lichen or moss. 

You can tell they love what they do and the science is better for it. Thank you Carolyn and Randy.
