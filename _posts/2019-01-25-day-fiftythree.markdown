# Skyping with a school in Flagstaff
Today was particularly special. We skyped with the Sinagua Middle School in Flagstaff. The three of us, Kelly, Alicia and I, answered questions from students in 6th grade in Ms. Kathryn Wertz's class. Kathryn is a science teacher who loves what she does. She enjoys novel ways of introducing her students to science - including having them talk directly to us scientists in Antarctica! 

We held the Skype session outside - it was a sunny, beautiful (but windy!) day. The kids had a nice view of the glacier.

We extended the Skype session, so we could talk to students in two different classes. We were so excited to talk to them. We were also impressed with the good questions! We hoped they heard us OK - it was windy! We even had a box around the computer to keep the wind from hitting the microphone.

Thank you Sinagua students!!!! We hope you remain as curious as we scientists are! There is much to learn about our beautiful planet (and other planets too)!
