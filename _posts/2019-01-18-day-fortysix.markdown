# Humpback whales
Today our group went aboard the cruiseship Zaandam to give presentations about the science on station. We had a great time and met many wonderful people. 

We saw several humpback whales from the vessel, including one centrally located in the photo below. The number of whales increases as the summer progresses. Humpbacks migrate from lower latitude areas (e.g. central and South America) where they breed to high latitude areas (such as near Palmer Station) where they find plenty of food.

Humpbacks are the most common whale in this area. These gentle giants were nearly extirpated in the Southern Ocean as about two million whales were killed during commercial whaling in the previous century. Thus, it is quite gratifying to see so many of them these last few days, knowing that they are recovering from their near-annihiliation. Humpbacks are recognized by the patterns on the underside of their fluke (tail). They are baleen whales that eat mostly krill - using their baleens to prevent krill from leaving their mouths as they push the seawater out through the baleens. This is called filter feeding. However, there is still much we do not know about these gentle creatures.

The Palmer Station group focuses on understanding the ecology of the humpback whales, such as feeding behavior, or how the populations are structured (e.g. who is related to who?). In order to understand the genetics and health of these whales scientists collect a tiny pencil-sized sample of the blubber and skin of each whale. The scientists are out there, rain or shine, collecting samples or data, because the whales are out there (whales could care less about the weather!)
