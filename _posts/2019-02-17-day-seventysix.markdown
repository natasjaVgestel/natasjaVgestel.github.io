# Civilization:   
Recently a colleague asked me when I was returning to civilization. I knew he meant to a place with more internet. But it made me question the words *returning to civilization*. 

Here at Palmer Station, people are kind, hard-working, and respectful. Each and everyone of us contributes to the Palmer community in our own way. We have events, such as an art show, travel logs (where people share their experiences of places they traveled to), science talks, movie nights, and we celebrate the Holidays and birthdays (see photo below).

Everyone of us also has a task that keeps the station going: the carpenters, electricians, the marine technicians (for boating operations), the radio operator (a duty shared by several people), the chefs, the information technology people, and so on. We also work together in keeping the buildings clean, no distinction based on what you do here - a contractor or scientist: everyone is treated equally. Dishes/kitchen cleaning are done by groups of people every evening - all of us take a turn.

We are an entire community dedicated to the success of this station while doing so we also create a sense of family. I would say that Palmer Station constitutes an oasis of civilization.
