# Stepping back - 
It has been superbusy the last several weeks: finding sites, getting pre-treatment measurements, setting up the warming experiment, then more measurements, starting field and lab incubations, and so on. What I find though is that it has surprisingly not been as stressful as I thought it would be. Why is that? First, I have an excellent team: with Kelly and Alicia's help the research has gone pretty smoothly (aside from the Skua issues - but that is outside our power). Second, people at Palmer Station, especially Randy, Carolyn, the marine technicians (MTs) and birders who have taken us to Litchfield by zodiac or SOLAS, have been great at supporting our science. Third, the scenery. Growing up, I have always enjoyed my moments alone outside, watching birds, walking in the woods, etc. - always feeling more refreshed afterwards. So, nature has always energized me. 

The same is true for my husband [Kenneth Schmidt](https://schmidtlab.weebly.com/), a professor in Biological Sciences at [Texas Tech](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biology/) - so we both feel similarly connected to nature.

So sometimes it is nice to step back. Take it all in. We will handle the challenges as they come.

Thanks Kelly, for capturing my hike to our site on Litchfield Island (with snow shoes in tow). Indeed, taking it all in! We are so lucky to be doing our research here.
