# Our first full day at Sea
The first stretch of our journey is smooth. There are a few albatrosses around as well as dolphins. The black-and-white Commerson's dolphins are the first marine mammals that we sighted.

We are in the Le Maire Strait, navigating past [Isla de los Estados][Isla-Estados]. This is the last bit of land we will see as we make our way towards the Drake Passage. It truly is an impressive island with sheer peaks.

Now that we rounded the corner and went between the Isla de los Estados and the southern tip of mainland South America, the Tierra del Fuego area, we will be cruising into the Drake Passage. You can see it is starting to become a bit more ... interesting. Let's see how we fare tomorrow!
