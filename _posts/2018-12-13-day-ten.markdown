# Neumayer channel - 
Wow. I just do not know where to start. We went through the Neumayer channel which leads towards Palmer Station. I honestly think pictures speak louder than words. Enjoy the last stretch of our voyage by sea:

The channel was narrow, but the last stretch opened up a bit more. The clouds in the sky parted also, revealing patches of beautiful blue sky. A promising sign.

# Arrived at Palmer
We docked at the pier at Palmer Station. Bruce and Kelly were eager to enter the Palmer station area. Let the science begin!

We had a warm welcome at the station. Looking forward to becoming a member of the Palmer station family.
