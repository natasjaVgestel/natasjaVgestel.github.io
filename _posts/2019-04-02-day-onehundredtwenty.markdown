# Power on station:
Palmer Station has power because of fuel. [Yesterday](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/04/01/day-onehundrednineteen) I helped with the fuel transfer. But what kind of fuel is it? This station uses low-sulfur diesel.  This type of fuel is less polluting than the high-sulfur type (e.g. less particulate matter and sulfur emissions).

Antarctica has been designated as an Emissions Control Area. A ban on high-sulfur fuel for cruise ships in 2011 was a welcome change to the delicate Antarctic environment. This ban was put in place by the International Maritime Organizations, an agency of the United Nations. 

Meet John, the Lead power plant mechanic. John's responsibilities on station affect everyone as he ensures we have power. The fuel used for power is stored in two large fuel tanks on station, each able to hold 125,000 gallons.

However, John also ensures the vehicles are operational. Unfortunately, the SkyTrak is currently in the shop needing some TLC (and actually a part for the differential). 

Thank you, John for keeping us warm at Palmer Station and for keeping the vehicles going!
