# Field season finale:
Alas, the field season has come to an end. Snow is falling and is here to stay. It has been snowing a lot over the last few days. We found a break in the weather today, which allowed us to take down the sites in the Palmer "backyard" ([yesterday](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/03/21/day-onehundredeight) was Litchfield). A good thing: the open-top chambers were still, but barely, visible! The control plots (with no chambers) would have been impossible to find were it not for the sensor cables attached to the loggers that guided us to the plots.

It was a beautiful day today. However, the snow also made it challenging to find the stainless steel collars and nails. We had help from Rich Harper (doc) and Randy Jones. Their help was much needed! 

Thank you, Randy and Rich for helping us today!
