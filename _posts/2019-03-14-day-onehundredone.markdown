# Pi day:
It was a particularly exciting science day today and not just because it is March 14 or 3.14 (i.e., Pi day!). ![Christina Koch](https://www.nasa.gov/astronauts/biographies/christina-h-koch), a former research associate of Palmer Station, was a member of the three-person space team headed to the International Space Station. We all watched the launch at 4 PM from the lounge at Palmer Station.

If you would like to know more about what Christina did at Palmer Station, check to see what Marissa Goerke is currently doing - see [day 73](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/02/14/day-seventythree) of my blog. Christina worked at Palmer Station just before she became an astronaut in 2013. She will work as a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station for two expeditions (59 and 60), so about 6 months.

The space craft used to get Christina and her colleagues to the space station was the Soyuz MS-12. It was launched from Kazakhstan. The final speed of this powerful aircraft was 7.5 km (= 4.66 miles) per *second*. Below is an image just below that speed.

We Palmerites are particularly proud of Christina's achievement!
