# The Backyard area
Our main study site is the area between the Palmer Research Station and the glacier that has receded several hundred meters. It is known here as the "Backyard". 

We have walked miles and miles in the Backyard since our arrival. Keri Nelson took a photo of us during one of our many treks to our study plots.

When you start naming areas that have now become too familiar, you know you spent a lot of time there. So far we have names like: Yoda (or Jedi) rock, knee rock (banged my knee on it), Quicksand Canyon. 

However, we have great news! We have now officially started the warming experiment. Our cone-shaped warming chambers are now up in all three sites in the backyard. Though tired (it was a very long day for us), we feel victorious!
