# Litchfield incubation experiment: 
We set up the soil incubation experiment at Litchfield a similar way as we did for experimental plots in the backyard (see [day 34](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/01/06/day-thirtyfour)). To get to Litchfield there is a short boat ride involved! We had company also: Dr. Zicheng Yu and his team who will be examining the beautiful moss peatbanks. But more about his interesting research later!

This time we inserted small cores into the moss. The cores this time were actually bottom parts of falcon tubes. Kelly cut cute moss plugs and inserted each into its own little tube (left photo below). Alicia added the water treatment and then capped the tube to prevent evaporation. I then reinserted the capped tube back into where it came from (right photo).

Again, Skuas were watching us! We are pretty sure they are plotting something. We just hope they leave our site alone. They are very handsome birds though, but perhaps too curious!
