# A valiant final attempt:
Another beautiful sunrise this morning, with some breaks in the clouds in the sky (despite my weather apps predictions). This motivated me to go to Litchfield today for final carbon flux measurements and the take-down of our experimental plots. All I needed was a 1-hr period of no precipitation. If you saw my blog from [yesterday](https://natasjavgestel.github.io/blog/2019/03/20/day-onehundredseven) you might guess what happened. 

The moment we initiated the measurements, snow started falling - gently at first, but then a snow blizzard ensued. This meant we had to forego the final carbon flux measurements, pack up the LI-COR instrument, and focus instead on taking down the site.

This also means my field season has ended. We had the sites up as soon as the snow had melted earlier in the season and we are now taking it down, now that the snow is remaining on the ground. So, we made the most of this year's summer season.

It was a good thing that we had taken the Litchfield site down today - more snow accumulation will make the take-down harder. By the time we got back to station, our field equipment was covered in a layer of snow (and so were we!)

Thank you, Moss and NÃ¡ndi for helping us out today!
